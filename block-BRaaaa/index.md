#### Movie Watchlist App

So before going into React let's try to understand the problem it solves. To do that we will be making a small application using JavaScript named "Movie Watch List App". To create this application use HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Make sure to watch this video before making the application

</div>

#### Requirements

- User can add a movie name to the list
- If you press enter the movie name will be added to the list (like a todo list)
- Each movie will have status (either watched or to watch)
- Default status will be `To Watch`
- Clicking on button should change the state form `To Watch` to `Watched` or vice versa.

#### How to make app

- In this folder you will find a `html`, `css` and `js` file.
- Add code in the respective files
